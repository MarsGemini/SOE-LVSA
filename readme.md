This is the website repo for the initiative "SOE (Scene-Object-Evaluation) AI4Edu Pipeline for LVSA (LLM-based Virtual Student Agents)", which aims to evaluate the role-playing potential of the LLMs in constructing human-liked and personalised virtual students by proposing a AI4Edu Pipeline for modeling LLM-based virtual student agents.

The templete of this webpage is based on <a href="https://llm-misinformation.github.io/">LLMs Meet Misinformation</a> and <a href="https://huuuuusy.github.io/fiova/">FIOVA(Five-in-One Video Annotations) Benchmark</a> projects, thanks a lot for their good project webpages.
